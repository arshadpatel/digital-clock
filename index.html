            <h2>Description</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>This is an Application made using Java Swings. Java Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC)
                    that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing
                    Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea,
                    JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is a Digital Clock application which not only shows time but also has features such as
                    Stopwatch and Timer in which all uses Digitial-7 Font. It is a very light weight application made
                    using only single frame, it doesnot
